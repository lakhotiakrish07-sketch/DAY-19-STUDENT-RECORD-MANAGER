# Student Record Book (Python)

This is a simple beginner-level Python mini project created as part of my daily GitHub learning (Day 19).

The project demonstrates the use of **dictionaries** and **basic file handling** to store, view, and remove student records.

---

## Features
- Add student records using roll number and name
- View saved records from a file
- Remove records by roll number
- Data stored using Python file handling

---

## Concepts Used
- Python dictionaries
- Dictionary update and delete operations
- File handling (read and write)
- Converting a dictionary to a string using `str()`
- Menu-driven program structure
- Understanding file modes (`w` vs `a`)

---

## File Used
recordbook.txt


Records are stored in dictionary string format, for example:
{101: 'Krish', 102: 'Aman'}
